# voice_recorder
:sound:

firstly install sounddevice and soundfile by using
`pip install sounddevice`
and `pip install soundfile`
after this just copy and paste the code and run it by using this command
`python {file_name}`
you will see the pop up interface where you can record your voice

Note: this will only run for 10 sec. if you want to increase the time then just go to line line 9 in the code and change the time delay.
